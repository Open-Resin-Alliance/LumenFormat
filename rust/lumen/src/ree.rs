//! Run-end encoded layer masks ([`spec/11-layer-encoding.md`] section 5).
//!
//! Three tags are defined: binary REE (`0x00`), grayscale REE (`0x01`) and split
//! REE (`0x02`). A layer whose pixels are all zero has no stream at all - the
//! empty-layer form lives in the `LTBL` entry, not in the layer data.
//!
//! Every run-length or position array is stored as four significance planes
//! ([`spec/11-layer-encoding.md`] section 5.3.1): the four plane lengths, then the
//! bytes of plane 0, plane 1, plane 2 and plane 3. A varint's byte `j` belongs to
//! plane `j`, so a length's high byte stops sitting between two noisy low bytes and
//! the compressor can see that it is nearly constant along a scanline.
