//! Writing a file: [`Encoder`], which assembles a conforming `.lumen` container.
//!
//! The encoder owns the choices the specification leaves to it (section 5.6): it
//! picks a tag per layer, picks how many layers a `LAYR` chunk spans, and decides
//! whether to train a dictionary. Layer masks are encoded as they are pushed, so
//! the encoder never holds the pixel data of the whole print - only its run-end
//! encoded form.
//!
//! The layer axis is cut into groups of [`DEFAULT_LAYERS_PER_CHUNK`] layers (or
//! whatever [`Encoder::set_layers_per_chunk`] asks for), and each (sector,
//! layer-group) becomes one `LAYR` chunk holding that sector's masks for the
//! group as a single zstd frame. `LTBL` then records, per (layer, sector), which
//! chunk holds the layer's run, where in that chunk's decompressed output the
//! run sits, and which `LROV` chunk carries the (layer, sector)'s overrides.
//!
//! Two of `finish`'s passes are a function of one item each: one zstd frame per
//! (sector, layer-group) chunk, and one `LHAS` leaf per layer. Neither reads
//! another's result, so both run across worker threads
//! ([`Encoder::set_worker_threads`]) - which is where the time of a long print
//! sits once its masks are encoded. The file does not depend on how many: an
//! item is placed by the index it came from, not by the order it finished in.
//!
//! `finish` produces the container in the order section 3 recommends: `HEAD`,
//! `META`, the optional chunks, `LTBL`, `LAYR`, and the directory at the end.
//! Payloads are 8-byte aligned, as section 3.2 prefers, and the trailer's
//! CRC-32C covers every preceding byte.
//!
//! Encryption follows section 9.1 exactly: `HEAD`, `AUTH`, `LTBL`, `LHAS` and the
//! `LAYR` version fields stay plaintext; `META`, `PROF`, `LROV`, `VOXL` and
//! `ZDIC` are sealed as single units; each `LAYR` frame is its own unit, bound by
//! its associated data to the chunk's directory index. `PREV` and `EXTD` are
//! written in the clear, which section 9.1 permits and which keeps a thumbnail
//! usable without a key.
