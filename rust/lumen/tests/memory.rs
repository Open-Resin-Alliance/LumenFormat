//! Peak memory of validating a file, measured rather than reasoned about.
//!
//! Section 4.10 asks a memory-constrained reader to verify one chunk at a time -
//! "peak memory is one chunk plus the leaf hash table, never the whole layer
//! stream". That is a property of *this* implementation too, and an easy one to
//! lose: collecting every decompressed chunk before checking any of them gives
//! the same answer only while the file is small.
//!
//! So this measures. It installs a counting allocator and compares three peaks:
//! one chunk decompressed, every chunk decompressed one after another, and a
//! full validation pass. Validation must cost about what the sequential walk
//! costs, because that is what "one chunk at a time" means in practice; if the
//! chunks are accumulated instead, the third number grows with the file while
//! the second does not.
//!
//! It lives in its own test binary with a single test, so the high-water mark it
//! reads is not polluted by anything else running concurrently.
